# Introduction

The course aims to learn about Robot Control Algorithms.

Each Assignment shown here has a detailed explanation in its directory. Please refer to the individual directories for an in-depth explanation of how the code works.

ðŸ—’*Note: If you understand the codes enough and are smart enough, it will be super simple to port it to the system that you like. I understand coding enough to build all these things but still am not too expert to build cross-platform products yet!*

# Assignments

## [Assignment 0: Setup Environment](./Docs/Programming%20Assignment%200/)

The aim of the [Assignment 0](./Docs/Programming%20Assignment%200/) is to set up the environment and try a basic run of programming.

## [Assignment 1: 2 DoF Revolute Revolute Robot Arm Equation of Motion](https://github.com/parth-20-07/2-DoF-Revolute-Revolute-robot-arm-Equation-of-Motion)

The aim of [Assignment 1: 2 DoF Revolute Revolute Robot Arm Equation of Motion](https://github.com/parth-20-07/2-DoF-Revolute-Revolute-robot-arm-Equation-of-Motion) is to develop the Equations of Motion for a 2 DoF Revolute Revolute Robot Arm using the Euler-Lagrange Method.

## [Assignment 2: Position Tracking using State Feedback Controller Design for a 2 DoF RRBot](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Position-Tracking-using-State-Feedback-Controller-Design-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot)

The aim of [Assignment 2: Position Tracking using State Feedback Controller Design for a 2 DoF RRBot](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Position-Tracking-using-State-Feedback-Controller-Design-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot) is to test the stability of a 2 DoF RRBot and design position tracking using a State-Feedback Controller.

## [Assignment 3](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Trajectory-Tracking-using-State-Feedback-Linearization-Control-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot)

The aim of [Assignment 3](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Trajectory-Tracking-using-State-Feedback-Linearization-Control-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot) is to learn polynomial Trajectory Generation for a 2 DoF RRBot and design trajectory tracker using State-Feedback Linearlization Controller.

## [Assignment 4](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Trajectory-Tracking-using-Robust-Controller-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot)

The aim of [Assignment 4](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Trajectory-Tracking-using-Robust-Controller-for-a-2-DoF-RRBot) is to design Robust Controller for Trajectory Tracking for a 2 DoF RRBot.

# [Final Project](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Sliding-Mode-Control-Based-3D-Trajectory-Tracking-for-UAVs)
Project Topic: [**Sliding Mode Control Based 3D Trajectory Tracking for UAV**](https://github.com/parth-20-07/Sliding-Mode-Control-Based-3D-Trajectory-Tracking-for-UAVs)

The project focuses on 3D Trajectory Tracking for a Crazyflie based UAV by developing Sliding Mode Control.

Tools used: ROS 1, Python, Gazebo
